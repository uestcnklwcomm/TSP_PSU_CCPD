Quick start

1. Clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/uestcnklwcomm/TSP_PSU_CCPD.git
cd TSP_PSU_CCPD
```

2. Open the project in MATLAB or run scripts from the MATLAB command window.

Notes
- Many files are MATLAB `.m` scripts; make sure MATLAB (R2016b or later recommended) is installed.
- Large binary `.mat` files are ignored by `.gitignore`. If you need to version large datasets, consider using Git LFS.
